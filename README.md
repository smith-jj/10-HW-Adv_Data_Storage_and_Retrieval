## Hawaii Climate Exploration & Analysis

See the Explorartion and Analysis folder 

* Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and SQLAlchemy we explore the climate databases and do a climate analysis of the Hawaii's climate. 
* The Jupyter Notebook, Analysis_Complete, explores the climate data, analysis the precipitation of stations over a 12 month time period, and finds the station with the most gathered data. 


## Surfs Up App

See the Exploration and Analysis folder 

Now that you have completed your initial analysis, design a Flask API based on the queries that you have just developed.

* Using FLASK we created an app, surfs_up_app.py 
* Users can call information about weather stations and the climate information using the app to help them determine the peak dates for visiting Hawaii.
